# BlazorProductivityProject

This project is a try to gather all the "right" solutions for server-side blazor in one place.

I didn't find any projects for rtl and farsi language, so I hope this will help those who will start a Blazor Server-side project.

<h3>Solutions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>CRUD with modal</li>
  <li>File upload on server - FileService</li>
  <li>Product Gallery</li>
  <li>Parent-Child Communication</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Sources:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Build Real world application with Blazor .NET Core 3.1 (by Bhurgen Patel)</li>
</ol>

This project is not completed yet.
<br/>
I will try to complete it in time.
<br/>
If you have any questions please ask.
